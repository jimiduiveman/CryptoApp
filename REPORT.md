## Technical Design 

### Overview
First of all the user will see a page where they can register themselves or login. \
Whenever they've logged in or registered, they will be re-directed to the overview of all cryptocurrencies. \
When a certain coin is tapped, a new page will be shown with some details of this coin. \
Here users can see the price history of the coin and some other details. \
On this page users can also add a transaction that they've made. \
This transaction will be visible under the tab "Trades". \
Furthermore, users can watch their "Portfolio" which will show the current value of their holdings. \
At last, users can also communicate with eachother by messages. \

### Login/Register page
When an user opens the app for the first time they don't have an account yet. \
They can register themselves with an emailaddress and a password. \
If it isn't the first time opening the app, users can login with their credentials. \
All of this will be checked against data stored in Firebase. \
