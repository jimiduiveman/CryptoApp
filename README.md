# CryptoApp

## Problem statement

People who are active in the fairly new world of the cryptocurrencies want to stay updated all day.
They don't want to check every coin by searching the web and they don't want to continously authenticate themselves (multiple times, 2fa incl.). But they want to see the latest statistics of the coins and the total value of their portfolio. In addition you want to stay up to date with regards to news.

## Solution

This app will allow users to check their portfolio all day without continously authenticating themselves (just once).
They will have an overview of the top 200 coins and their statistics, but also the latest update of their portfolio.
Users can fill in their trades, which will be saved.
In addition their is a social aspect, you can watch some of the activities of your friends and messages from them.
